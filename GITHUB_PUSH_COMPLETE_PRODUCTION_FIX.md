# ‚úÖ GITHUB PUSH COMPLETE - PRODUCTION FIX DEPLOYED

## üéØ WHAT WAS FIXED

Your bot wasn't running in production because Vercel serverless functions timeout after 60-900 seconds. The bot tried to run as a long-lived process with node-cron, which doesn't work on Vercel.

**Solution:** Implemented Vercel Cron Jobs for reliable production scheduling.

## üìã NEXT STEPS (CRITICAL)

### STEP 1: Add CRON_SECRET to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: **affilatebot-wbaw** project
3. Click: **Settings** (top menu)
4. Click: **Environment Variables** (left sidebar)
5. Add new variable:
   ```
   Name: CRON_SECRET
   Value: your-secret-key-here
   Environment: Production
   Click: Save
   ```

### STEP 2: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: **affilatebot-wbaw**
3. Click: **Deployments**
4. Watch for latest deployment to complete
5. Status should change to "READY"

### STEP 3: Verify Health Endpoint (Immediate)

```
Open in browser:
https://affilatebot-wbaw.vercel.app/health

Should show:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "server": true,
    "database": true,
    "telegram": true,
    "scheduler": true,
    "imageCache": true
  }
}
```

### STEP 4: Test Manual Cron Trigger (Immediate)

```bash
curl -X GET https://affilatebot-wbaw.vercel.app/api/cron \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key-here"

Should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cron job executed successfully",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

### STEP 5: Wait for First Cron Job (2 hours)

- Vercel will call `/api/cron` every 2 hours
- Bot will fetch deals and post to Telegram
- Check @amazondealsmake channel for posts

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS

After completing all steps:
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns "healthy"
- ‚úÖ Manual cron trigger returns success
- ‚úÖ Scheduler logs show "Ready for Vercel Cron Jobs"
- ‚úÖ Telegram posts appear every 2 hours
- ‚úÖ Vercel logs show "Vercel Cron Job triggered"
