# ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED: Discount Filter & Best Product Selection

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Time**: 19:59 IST  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **BOTH ISSUES FIXED**

---

## üéØ Issues Reported

### Issue 1: Incorrect Discount Filter
**Problem**: Bot was posting products with less than 85% discount, even though MIN_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE was set to 85 in .env

**Root Cause**: The platform settings in the database had `min_discount: 50`, which overrode the .env setting

### Issue 2: Multiple Products Posted Per Job
**Problem**: Bot was posting up to 10 products per run instead of selecting only the best one

**Root Cause**: Scheduler was posting ALL new products instead of selecting the single best product

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Updated Database Platform Settings

**Action**: Used Supabase MCP to update the `min_discount` for amazon-scraper platform

**SQL Executed**:
```sql
UPDATE platform_settings 
SET min_discount = 85 
WHERE platform = 'amazon-scraper';
```

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT platform, min_discount FROM platform_settings WHERE platform = 'amazon-scraper';
-- Result: min_discount = 85 ‚úÖ
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Platform now correctly filters products with 85%+ discount

---

### Fix 2: Modified Scheduler to Select Best Product

**File Modified**: `src/scheduler.js`

**Changes Made**:

**Before** (Lines 94-109):
```javascript
logger.info(`Posting ${newProducts.length} new deals to Telegram`);

// Post deals to Telegram (products already have affiliate links)
const postedCount = await telegramBot.sendMultiplePlatformDeals(newProducts);

// Mark products as posted in database (platform-aware)
for (const product of newProducts) {
  await platformDatabase.markAsPosted(product);
}

logger.success(`‚úÖ Job completed successfully! Posted ${postedCount} new deals`);
```

**After** (Lines 94-113):
```javascript
// Select ONLY the product with the HIGHEST discount
const bestProduct = newProducts.reduce((best, current) => {
  return (current.discountPercentage > best.discountPercentage) ? current : best;
}, newProducts[0]);

logger.info(`Found ${newProducts.length} new products. Selecting best deal: ${bestProduct.title.substring(0, 50)}... (${bestProduct.discountPercentage}% off)`);
logger.info(`Posting 1 best deal to Telegram (highest discount: ${bestProduct.discountPercentage}%)`);

// Post only the best deal to Telegram
const postedCount = await telegramBot.sendMultiplePlatformDeals([bestProduct]);

// Mark only the best product as posted in database
await platformDatabase.markAsPosted(bestProduct);

logger.success(`‚úÖ Job completed successfully! Posted ${postedCount} best deal (${bestProduct.discountPercentage}% discount)`);
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Bot now selects and posts only the single product with highest discount

---

## üß™ Testing Results

### Test 1: Discount Filter (85% Threshold)

**Test Script**: `test-discount-filter.js`

**Result**:
```
‚úÖ Found 0 products with 85%+ discount
‚ö†Ô∏è  No products found with 85%+ discount
   This is expected - very few products have such high discounts
```

**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ Filter is working correctly - rejecting products below 85%

---

### Test 2: Best Product Selection Logic

**Test Script**: `test-best-product-selection.js`

**Test Data**: 2 products with 50%+ discount
- Product 1: 79% discount
- Product 2: 78% discount

**Result**:
```
Selected Best Product:
   Discount: 79%

Verification:
   Highest discount in set: 79%
   Selected product discount: 79%
   Match: ‚úÖ YES

‚úÖ PASS: Selection logic correctly picks highest discount product
```

**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ Selection logic is working correctly

---

### Test 3: Live Bot Execution

**First Job After Fix** (19:59 IST):

**Scraped**: 10 products from Amazon.in  
**Filtered**: 5 products with 85%+ discount  
**New Products**: 1 (4 were already posted)  
**Selected**: Fire-Boltt watch with **94% discount** (highest)  
**Posted**: 1 product only ‚úÖ

**Log Output**:
```
[INFO] [Amazon Scraper] Scraped 10 products
[INFO] [Amazon Scraper] Returning 5 filtered products
[INFO] Found 5 potential deals from all platforms
[INFO] Found 1 new products. Selecting best deal: Fire-Boltt... (94% off)
[INFO] Posting 1 best deal to Telegram (highest discount: 94%)
[SUCCESS] Deal posted to Telegram: Fire-Boltt from amazon-scraper
[SUCCESS] ‚úÖ Job completed successfully! Posted 1 best deal (94% discount)
```

**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ Both fixes working perfectly in production!

## üìä Expected Bot Behavior (After Fixes)

### Every 2 Minutes (Test Schedule):

1. **Scrape Products**
   - Fetch 10-20 products from Amazon.in
   - Example: 10 products scraped

2. **Apply 85% Discount Filter**
   - Filter to ONLY products with 85%+ discount
   - Example: 5 products pass filter (5 rejected)

3. **Check for Duplicates**
   - Remove products already posted
   - Example: 4 already posted, 1 new product

4. **Select Best Product**
   - From new products, select the ONE with highest discount
   - Example: 1 product with 94% discount selected

5. **Post to Telegram**
   - Post ONLY that one product
   - Example: 1 product posted ‚úÖ

6. **Save to Database**
   - Mark only that product as posted
   - Example: 1 record saved

### Possible Outcomes Per Run:

**Scenario A: Products Found**
- Scraped: 10 products
- Filtered (85%+): 3 products
- New: 2 products
- **Posted: 1 product** (highest discount)

**Scenario B: No Products Meet Threshold**
- Scraped: 10 products
- Filtered (85%+): 0 products
- **Posted: 0 products** (wait for next run)

**Scenario C: All Already Posted**
- Scraped: 10 products
- Filtered (85%+): 5 products
- New: 0 products (all duplicates)
- **Posted: 0 products** (wait for next run)

## üéØ Key Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå Posted products with 50%+ discount (not 85%+)
- ‚ùå Posted up to 10 products per run
- ‚ùå No quality control on discount percentage
- ‚ùå Channel could be spammed with many products

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Posts ONLY products with 85%+ discount
- ‚úÖ Posts ONLY 1 product per run (the best one)
- ‚úÖ Quality over quantity approach
- ‚úÖ Channel receives only the best deals
- ‚úÖ Users see only the highest discount products

## üìù Files Modified

- **Column**: `min_discount`
- **Change**: 50 ‚Üí 85
- **Platform**: amazon-scraper

### 2. src/scheduler.js
- **Lines Modified**: 94-120
- **Changes**:
  - Added best product selection logic using `reduce()`
  - Changed from posting all products to posting only best product
  - Updated logging to show selection process

---

## üîç How to Verify Fixes

### Method 1: Check Logs
Watch the terminal for these messages:
```
[INFO] [Amazon Scraper] Returning X filtered products
[INFO] Found X new products. Selecting best deal: [Product]... (XX% off)
[INFO] Posting 1 best deal to Telegram (highest discount: XX%)
[SUCCESS] Posted 1 best deal (XX% discount)
```

### Method 2: Check Telegram Channel
- Go to https://t.me/amazondealsmake
- Verify only 1 product is posted every 2 minutes
- Verify all products have 85%+ discount

### Method 3: Check Database
```sql
SELECT 
  product_id, 
  title, 
  discount_percentage, 
  posted_at 
FROM posted_deals 
WHERE platform = 'amazon-scraper' 
ORDER BY posted_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
- All products should have discount_percentage >= 85
- Only 1 product should be posted per 2-minute interval

### Method 4: Run Test Scripts
```bash
# Test discount filter
node test-discount-filter.js

# Test selection logic
node test-best-product-selection.js
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. 85% Discount is Very Rare
- Most Amazon products have 30-70% discount
- 85%+ discount products are uncommon
- Bot may post 0 products for several runs
- This is EXPECTED behavior with 85% filter

### 2. Recommendation for More Posts
If you want more frequent posts, consider:
- Lowering discount to 70-80% (still high quality)
- Or keeping 85% but accepting fewer posts

### 3. Adjusting the Filter
To change the discount threshold:

**Option A: Via Database** (Recommended)
```sql
UPDATE platform_settings 
SET min_discount = 70 
WHERE platform = 'amazon-scraper';
```

**Option B: Via Admin Panel**
- Access admin panel
- Update platform settings
- Change min_discount for amazon-scraper

Then restart the bot.
