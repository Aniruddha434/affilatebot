## üìù Issues Fixed

**Solution**: Created `enable-amazon-scraper.js` script to configure database  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Issue 2: Database Column Mismatch
**Problem**: Code was using `asin` column, but table has `product_id`  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `platformDatabase.js` to use `product_id`
- Updated database function `is_product_posted()`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Issue 3: Cron Schedule
**Problem**: Schedule was every 2 hours (too slow for testing)  
**Solution**: Updated `.env` to run every 2 minutes  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. High Discount Filter (85%)
- Very few products have 85%+ discount
- You may see many searches with 0 products posted
- **Recommendation**: Lower to 50-70% for more products

### 2. Testing Schedule (Every 2 Minutes)
- This is ONLY for testing
- Remember to change back to production schedule
- Use admin panel or edit `.env`

### 3. Partner Tag
- Currently using default: `yourtag-21`
- Update with your real Amazon affiliate tag
- Edit `AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG` in `.env`

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Scraper has 1.5s delay between requests
- Don't reduce this delay
- Amazon may block if too aggressive
