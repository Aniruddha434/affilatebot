## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Table: `posted_deals`**

Tracks all Amazon deals posted to Telegram to prevent duplicates.

```sql
CREATE TABLE posted_deals (
  id                    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  asin                  VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  title                 TEXT,
  discount_percentage   INTEGER,
  posted_at            TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at           TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### **Column Descriptions**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-incrementing unique identifier |
| `asin` | VARCHAR(20) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | Amazon Standard Identification Number |
| `title` | TEXT | - | Product title at time of posting |
| `discount_percentage` | INTEGER | - | Discount percentage when posted |
| `posted_at` | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT NOW() | When deal was posted to Telegram |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT NOW() | When record was created in database |

---

## 🔍 Indexes

Optimized for fast lookups and queries:

| Index Name | Column(s) | Type | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|------|---------|
| `posted_deals_pkey` | id | UNIQUE | Primary key constraint |
| `posted_deals_asin_key` | asin | UNIQUE | Prevent duplicate ASINs |
| `idx_asin` | asin | BTREE | Fast ASIN lookups |
| `idx_posted_at` | posted_at | BTREE | Time-based queries |
| `idx_discount` | discount_percentage | BTREE | Filter by discount |

**Performance:** All critical queries use indexes for optimal speed.

## 🔒 Security Configuration

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**

✅ **Status:** ENABLED

RLS protects your data by enforcing access control at the database level.

### **RLS Policies**

| Policy Name | Command | Using | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `Allow bot operations` | ALL | `true` | Allows bot full CRUD access |

**Security Notes:**
- ✅ RLS is enabled for data protection
- ✅ Anon key is used (principle of least privilege)
- ✅ Policy allows all operations (bot is single-user system)
- ✅ Service role key is NOT exposed in code

---

## ✅ Verification Results

All database operations have been tested and verified:

- ✅ **Connection:** Successfully connected to Supabase
- ✅ **Table Access:** Can read from `posted_deals` table
- ✅ **INSERT:** Can add new records
- ✅ **SELECT:** Can query existing records
- ✅ **DELETE:** Can remove records
- ✅ **COUNT:** Can get statistics
- ✅ **RLS:** Policies working correctly

**Test Command:** `node verify-database.js`

---

## 📝 Environment Configuration

Your `.env` file has been created with the following Supabase configuration:

```env
# Supabase Database Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://dbnldknxqqsysfwlswtb.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** 
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Keep your Supabase keys secure
- The anon key is safe for client-side use but should still be protected

## 🚀 How the Bot Uses the Database

### **1. Duplicate Prevention**

Before posting a deal, the bot checks if the product (ASIN) has already been posted:

```javascript
const isPosted = await database.isProductPosted(product.asin);
if (!isPosted) {
  // Post to Telegram
  await telegramBot.sendDeal(product, affiliateLink);
  // Mark as posted
  await database.markAsPosted(product);
}
```

### **2. Tracking Posted Deals**

Every time a deal is posted to Telegram, it's recorded in the database:

```javascript
await database.markAsPosted({
  asin: 'B08N5WRWNW',
  title: 'Amazing Product',
  discountPercentage: 75
});
```

### **3. Statistics**

Get total number of deals posted:

```javascript
const count = await database.getPostedCount();
console.log(`Total deals posted: ${count}`);
```

### **4. Cleanup**

Automatically removes deals older than 30 days (runs daily at midnight):

```javascript
await database.cleanupOldEntries();
```

---

## 📊 Database Operations

### **View All Posted Deals**

```sql
SELECT * FROM posted_deals 
ORDER BY posted_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

WHERE posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY posted_at DESC;
```

### **Delete Old Deals**

WHERE posted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

```
