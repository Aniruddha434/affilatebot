# ‚è±Ô∏è NEXT STEPS - DO THIS NOW (5 MINUTES)

## üéØ YOUR BOT IS BEING FIXED RIGHT NOW

**Status:** Vercel is deploying the critical fix
**Time:** 2-3 minutes until deployment complete
**Action:** Follow these steps

---

## STEP 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

```
1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: affilatebot-wbaw
3. Click: Deployments
4. Watch the latest deployment
5. Wait for status to change to: READY
```

**What you'll see:**
- Status: Building ‚Üí Ready
- Time: 2-3 minutes

---

## STEP 2: Test Health Endpoint (Immediate After Deployment)

```
1. Open new browser tab
2. Go to: https://affilatebot-wbaw.vercel.app/health
3. You should see JSON response (NOT 500 error)
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "uptime": 2.5,
  "checks": {
    "server": true,
    "database": true,
    "telegram": false,
    "scheduler": true,
    "imageCache": true
  }
}
```

**Important:** Status can be "degraded" - that's OK! The bot still works!

---

## STEP 3: Verify Telegram Token (If Health Shows telegram: false)

If Telegram shows `false`, your token might be invalid:

```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: affilatebot-wbaw
3. Click: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Check: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
5. Verify: Token is correct and not expired
```

**If token is wrong:**
1. Get new token from @BotFather on Telegram
2. Update TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN in Vercel
3. Redeploy

---

## STEP 4: Test Cron Endpoint (Optional)

```bash
# Open terminal/command prompt
# Run this command:

curl -X GET https://affilatebot-wbaw.vercel.app/api/cron \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cron job executed successfully",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-16T06:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## STEP 5: Wait for First Cron Job (2 hours)

```
Timeline:
‚îú‚îÄ Now: Deployment complete
‚îú‚îÄ +2 hours: First cron job triggers
‚îú‚îÄ +2 hours: Bot fetches deals
‚îú‚îÄ +2 hours: Posts to Telegram
‚îî‚îÄ Every 2 hours: Repeats
```

**Check Telegram:** @amazondealsmake
