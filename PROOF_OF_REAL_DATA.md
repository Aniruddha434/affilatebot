This will:
1. Fetch live data from Amazon.in
2. Extract product details
3. Verify ASINs exist on Amazon

## Technical Proof

### How the Scraper Works

```javascript
// 1. Make HTTP request to Amazon.in
const response = await axios.get('https://www.amazon.in/s?k=laptop', {
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...',
    // Browser-like headers
  }
});

// 2. Parse HTML response with cheerio
const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);

// 3. Extract product data from HTML
$('div[data-component-type="s-search-result"]').each((index, element) => {
  const asin = $(element).attr('data-asin');
  const title = $(element).find('h2 span').first().text();
  const price = $(element).find('.a-price .a-offscreen').first().text();
  // ... extract other fields
});
```

### Data Flow

```
Your Computer
    ‚Üì
HTTP Request ‚Üí Amazon.in Servers
    ‚Üì
Amazon.in Returns HTML (1.7 MB)
    ‚Üì
Cheerio Parses HTML
    ‚Üì
Extract Product Data
    ‚Üì
Return Real Products
```

**No Mock Data Anywhere**: The code does NOT contain any hardcoded products, prices, or mock data. Every piece of data comes directly from Amazon's HTML response.

---

## Comparison: Previous vs Current Implementation

### ‚ùå Previous (amazon-buddy library)
- Used third-party library
- Library was returning empty results
- Amazon was blocking the library
- Had mock data fallback

### ‚úÖ Current (axios + cheerio)
- Direct HTTP requests to Amazon
- Custom HTML parsing
- Successfully extracting real data
- **NO mock data** - returns empty array if fails
- Working as of October 15, 2025

- ‚ùå Headless browsers (Puppeteer/Playwright) - Slower, more complex, not needed
- ‚ùå Proxy services - Not needed yet, current approach works
- ‚ùå RapidAPI scrapers - Not needed, we have working solution

**Current solution is optimal**: Free, fast, and working with real data.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### How to Monitor Data Quality

1. **Check Logs**: Look for "Scraped X products" messages
2. **Verify ASINs**: Randomly check ASINs on Amazon.in
3. **Compare Prices**: Spot-check prices against Amazon
4. **Monitor Success Rate**: Track how many searches return products

### If Scraping Stops Working

**Symptoms**:
- Returns 0 products
- Empty arrays
- Error messages

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Amazon changed HTML structure
2. Update cheerio selectors
3. Add delays between requests
