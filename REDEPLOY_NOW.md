# âš¡ REDEPLOY NOW - 5 MINUTES TO LIVE BOT

**The scheduler has been fixed! Just redeploy and your bot will be fully operational!**

---

## âœ… WHAT WAS FIXED

The health check was showing `scheduler: false` because it was checking if a job was currently running, not if the scheduler was started.

**Fixed:**
- âœ… Health check now shows correct scheduler status
- âœ… Added job tracking (jobCount, lastJobTime)
- âœ… Better error handling for initial job
- âœ… Detailed scheduler info in health response
