## 🔴 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **Issue #1: Duplicate Results Problem**

**Root Causes Found:**
1. ❌ Scheduler used hardcoded keyword array instead of database
2. ❌ Mock data returned identical products regardless of search term
3. ❌ Mock data generators explicitly deleted keyword filters
4. ❌ No keyword rotation or usage tracking

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Integrated database keyword management into scheduler
2. ✅ Implemented keyword-aware mock data generation
3. ✅ Removed keyword filter deletion in all platform adapters
4. ✅ Added least-recently-used keyword rotation with usage tracking
5. ✅ Added intelligent caching with keyword-based cache keys

---

### **Issue #2: Low Product Coverage**

**Root Causes Found:**
1. ❌ Amazon PA-API hard limit of 10 products per request
2. ❌ PlatformManager fetched `count * 2` then sliced to `count`
3. ❌ Scheduler only posted 1 product per run
4. ❌ No pagination or multiple search passes
5. ❌ Mock datasets had only 5-6 hardcoded products

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Increased fetch multiplier from 2x to 5x
2. ✅ Removed artificial result slicing in PlatformManager
3. ✅ Scheduler now fetches 5x more products (50 instead of 10)
4. ✅ Mock data generators create diverse products (10-50+ per search)
5. ✅ Added search result caching to reduce API calls

## 📁 Files Modified

### **1. src/modules/SearchCache.js** (NEW)
**Purpose:** Intelligent caching layer with keyword-based keys

**Features:**
- Keyword-based cache keys (prevents duplicate result issues)
- 15-minute TTL (configurable)
- Platform-aware caching
- LRU eviction when cache is full
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

**Key Methods:**
```javascript
searchCache.get(keywords, platform, filters)  // Get cached results
searchCache.set(keywords, products, platform, filters, ttl)  // Cache results
searchCache.invalidate(pattern)  // Clear specific entries
searchCache.getStats()  // Get cache statistics
```

---

### **2. src/scheduler.js** (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added SearchCache import
- ✅ Expanded fallback keywords from 10 to 20 diverse terms
- ✅ Added `lastKeywordIndex` for rotation tracking
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded keyword selection with `selectNextKeyword()` method
- ✅ Integrated cache checking before API calls
- ✅ Increased fetch limit from 10 to 50 products (5x multiplier)
- ✅ Added cache storage after successful fetches

**New Method: `selectNextKeyword()`**
- Fetches keywords from database
- Sorts by usage_count (least-used first)
- Increments usage tracking
- Falls back to hardcoded keywords if database empty
- Implements rotation to ensure variety

**Before:**
```javascript
const searchKeywords = ['electronics deals', 'fashion sale', ...];
const keyword = searchKeywords[Math.floor(Math.random() * searchKeywords.length)];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const keyword = await this.selectNextKeyword();  // Database-driven with fallback
let products = searchCache.get(keyword, 'all');  // Check cache first
if (!products) {
  products = await platformManager.fetchFromAllPlatforms(keyword, 50);  // 5x more
  searchCache.set(keyword, products, 'all');  // Cache results
}
```

### **3. src/modules/platforms/PlatformManager.js** (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Increased fetch multiplier from `count * 2` to `count * 5`
- ✅ Removed artificial slicing that limited results
- ✅ Returns all fetched products instead of limiting to `count`

**Before:**
```javascript
maxResults: count * 2,  // Fetch extra to account for filtering
...
return products.slice(0, count);  // ❌ Throws away extra products
```

**After:**
```javascript
maxResults: count * 5,  // Fetch 5x extra to maximize coverage
...
return products;  // ✅ Return all products, let scheduler decide
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### **1. Test Keyword Diversity**
```bash
# Run scheduler multiple times and verify different keywords are used
node src/index.js
# Check logs for: "Selected keyword from database: ..."
```

### **2. Test Mock Data Variety**
```javascript
// Test different keywords return different products
const products1 = await amazonAdapter.searchProducts('laptop deals', { maxResults: 20 });
const products2 = await amazonAdapter.searchProducts('fashion sale', { maxResults: 20 });
// Verify products1 and products2 are different
```

### **3. Test Cache Functionality**
```javascript
const searchCache = require('./src/modules/SearchCache');

// First search (cache miss)
const products1 = await platformManager.fetchFromAllPlatforms('headphones', 50);
console.log(searchCache.getStats());  // Should show 1 miss, 1 set

// Second search (cache hit)
const products2 = searchCache.get('headphones', 'all');
console.log(searchCache.getStats());  // Should show 1 hit
```

### **4. Test Database Keyword Integration**
```bash
# Add keywords via admin panel or API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/keywords \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "gaming laptop", "platform": null}'

# Run scheduler and verify it uses database keywords
```
