# Telegram Bot Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Quick Start

Your bot is configured with:
- **Bot Token**: `7731512306:AAHEhFMEydtCZajLx0g8HT_iR8iuN2SpfzE`
- **Channel**: `amazondealsmake`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Channel ID Format

Telegram requires the channel ID in one of these formats:

### For Public Channels:
```
@channelname
```
Example: `@amazondealsmake`

### For Private Channels/Groups:
```
-1001234567890
```
(A negative number starting with -100)

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Add Bot to Your Channel

1. Open your Telegram channel `amazondealsmake`
2. Click on the channel name at the top
3. Click "Administrators"
4. Click "Add Administrator"
5. Search for your bot: `@YourBotUsername`
6. Grant these permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Post messages
   - ‚úÖ Edit messages
   - ‚úÖ Delete messages (optional)

### 2. Get the Correct Channel ID

#### Method 1: For Public Channels
If your channel is public, use: `@amazondealsmake`

Update your `.env` file:
```env
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=@amazondealsmake
```

#### Method 2: For Private Channels/Groups
1. Forward any message from your channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
2. The bot will reply with the channel ID (e.g., `-1001234567890`)
3. Copy that ID

Update your `.env` file:
```env
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=-1001234567890
```

### 3. Test the Connection

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-telegram.js
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Verify bot token is valid
- ‚úÖ Try different channel ID formats
- ‚úÖ Send a test message to your channel
- ‚úÖ Tell you which format works

### 4. Test Complete Flow

Once Telegram connection works, test the complete flow:
```bash
node test-complete-flow.js
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Fetch mock products from all 3 platforms
- ‚úÖ Post 3 test deals to your Telegram channel
- ‚úÖ Verify the entire pipeline works

## üß™ Testing Commands

### Test 1: Telegram Connection Only
```bash
node test-telegram.js
```
**What it does**: Tests if bot can send messages to your channel

**Expected output**:
```
‚úÖ Bot connected: @YourBotName
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Messages can be sent to: @amazondealsmake
```

### Test 2: Complete Flow (Mock Data ‚Üí Telegram)
```bash
node test-complete-flow.js
```
**What it does**: 
- Fetches mock products from Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra
- Posts them to your Telegram channel

**Expected output**:
```
‚úÖ Platforms initialized: 3
‚úÖ Products fetched: 9
‚úÖ Test messages sent: 3
```

### Test 3: Start the Bot Server
```bash
npm start
```
Then click "Trigger Job Now" in the admin panel at http://localhost:3001/dashboard

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Chat not found" Error

**Cause**: Incorrect channel ID format or bot not added to channel

**Solution**:
1. Make sure bot is added as administrator to the channel
2. Try both formats:
   - `@amazondealsmake` (for public channels)
   - `-1001234567890` (for private channels - get from @userinfobot)

### Issue 2: "Bot was blocked by the user"

**Cause**: Bot doesn't have permission to post

**Solution**:
1. Remove bot from channel
2. Re-add bot as administrator
3. Grant "Post messages" permission

### Issue 3: "Trigger Job" Button Does Nothing

**Cause**: Backend server not running or API error

**Solution**:
1. Check if backend is running: `npm start`
2. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Verify `.env` file has all required variables

### Issue 4: No Products Being Posted

**Cause**: Amazon API credentials not active yet (2-day waiting period)

**Solution**:
‚úÖ **Already Fixed!** The bot now uses mock data for all platforms when real APIs fail.

Mock data includes:
- **Amazon**: 5 electronics products (phones, earbuds, smartwatch)
- **Flipkart**: 5 products (phone, shoes, laptop, headphones, watch)
- **Myntra**: 6 fashion products (shirts, jeans, dress, shoes, watch, bag)

### Issue 5: Rate Limiting Errors

**Cause**: Sending too many messages too quickly

**Solution**:
The bot automatically waits 2 seconds between messages. If you still get rate limited:
1. Reduce `MAX_PRODUCTS_PER_RUN` in `.env`
2. Increase `CRON_SCHEDULE` interval

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
npm start
```
Look for these log messages:
- `[Amazon] Falling back to mock data` ‚úÖ Good - using mock data
- `[Flipkart] Returning mock products` ‚úÖ Good - using mock data
- `[Myntra] Returning mock products` ‚úÖ Good - using mock data
- `Telegram bot initialized successfully` ‚úÖ Good - bot connected
- `Successfully sent deal to Telegram` ‚úÖ Good - message posted

### Check Admin Panel Logs
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Click "View Logs" card
3. Look for recent activity

---
