# 🔧 Vercel 404 Error - FIXED

**The 404 error has been fixed! Here's what was wrong and how to redeploy.**

---

## ❌ WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

Your Vercel deployment was showing **404: NOT_FOUND** because:

1. **Missing `vercel.json` configuration**
   - Vercel didn't know how to run your Node.js application
   - It was treating your project as a static site
   - No routes were configured

2. **No build output**
   - Vercel couldn't find any serverless functions
   - The application wasn't being started

3. **Missing Node.js runtime configuration**
   - Vercel needs to know to use `@vercel/node` runtime
   - Entry point wasn't specified

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED?

I've created a `vercel.json` configuration file that tells Vercel:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "src/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "src/index.js"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

**This tells Vercel to:**
- ✅ Use Node.js runtime
- ✅ Build `src/index.js` as the entry point
- ✅ Route all requests to your Express app
- ✅ Set NODE_ENV to production

---

## 📋 WHAT I DID

### Step 1: Created `vercel.json`
```
✅ File created: vercel.json
✅ Configuration added
✅ Node.js runtime specified
```

### Step 2: Committed to Git
```
✅ git add vercel.json
✅ git commit -m "Add vercel.json configuration for Node.js deployment"
✅ Commit: 39a8f02
```

### Step 3: Pushed to GitHub
```
✅ git push origin main
✅ Code pushed successfully
✅ Vercel will auto-redeploy
```

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Wait for Auto-Redeploy (2-3 minutes)
```
Vercel automatically detects the push and redeploys
You should see a new deployment in Vercel dashboard
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: affilatebot-wbaw
3. Go to: Deployments tab
4. Look for: New deployment (should be "Ready")
```

### Step 3: Test Your Bot
```
1. Open: https://affilatebot-wbaw.vercel.app/health
2. Expected response: {"status":"ok",...}
3. If you see this, the bot is working!
```

### Step 4: Verify Telegram Integration
```
1. Check your Telegram channel
2. Wait for scheduled job to run
3. Verify products are being posted
```
